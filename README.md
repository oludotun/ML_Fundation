## Machine Learning Statistical Foundations

This repository serves as a personal journal documenting my journey into the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I am exploring and learning key topics such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics, and other essential concepts that form the backbone of machine learning models and algorithms.

Through this repository, I aim to consolidate my understanding, share insights, and provide a structured reference for others who may be interested in mastering the core mathematical principles required for machine learning.

Feel free to explore the repository and join me in this exciting learning journey!
